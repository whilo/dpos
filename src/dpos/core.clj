;; - how is time and peer<->block sequence agreed upon?
;; - model double spending attack

;; https://steemit.com/eos/@eosgo/4izmr903
;; orthogonal design questions
;; - collect fees due to tx type (and cost)
;; - ensure public key integrity on system entry
;; - users can sign prior block in tx to validate block chain
;; - all peers should ack after receive new block to shorten irreversible ack, high water mark
;; - TODO 2/3 need to be byzantine for DPoS to fail (?)
